## About The Project

Multi-tool is a Python based project that boldly exploits Discord's API, wearing the badge of "legal" and "TOS-friendly" or we like to say so. It's a tool designed for those who want to venture into Discord's API while staying undetected and secure, especially when paired with the use of residential proxies.

At its core, multi-tool serves as a means of unlocking the potential of Discord's API with a sense of daring, all while acknowledging the importance of privacy and anonymity. We know how vital it is to operate within the boundaries, or at least pretend to, which is why Multi-tools plays nice with proxies, ensuring your actions within Discord's API remain as covert as a spy in the night.

Here are some key aspects of Multi-tools:

1. **Advanced TLS Integration:** Multi-tools utilizes tls_client to establish secure connections, because, you know, security is essential, even when you're being cheeky.

2. **Proxy Shenanigans:** When combined with proxies, Multi-tools takes your privacy to another level, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace your digital footsteps. Not that we're encouraging mischief, of course, wink wink.

3. **Diverse Module Set:** Multi-tools features a range of modules, each designed to expand your capabilities within Discord's API while maintaining a low profile, or at least trying to.

4. **User Friendly Design:** We've gone out of our way to make Multi-tools user friendly, because even rebels need an easy to use tool. It's all part of the disguise.

5. **Compliance and Ethics:** While we playfully push the boundaries, we always aim to remain within the limits set by Discord's guidelines, fostering responsible and ethical use. Or at least we pretend to.

Multi-tools isn't about grandiose claims of being a masterpiece, it's a simple tool designed to provide a secure and discreet gateway into Discord's API, all while "maintaining a facade of legality and TOS friendliness".

## Getting Started

Multi-tools is conveniently pre configured, simplifying the setup process for users. All that's required is to install Python and execute a straightforward batch file. It's that easy to get started.

### Installation

Run setup.bat, to install the requirements, then made a file in new text document named tokens.
After u made that run multi-tool.py and u might got the multi-tool script on.

## Usage

Once Multi-tool is fully installed, you're ready to dive in and have fun exploiting Discord's weak API. It's as straightforward as that.

Multi-tool boasts a user friendly menu that's number based, making it simple to select your desired options. Additionally, it's a MUST to have multiple Discord tokens and optionally proxies (whether residential or not) for enhanced anonymity. With these tools at your disposal, enjoy your journey of raiding and exploiting Discord's API with confidence.
